# Fight Club GvG bot
# Development documentation

## TODO (this documentation):
1. start moving everything after introduction to wiki pages
2. document entity relations: leagues know of their matches, participants, and roles. matches also know of their participants (in app, not in storage).
3. figure out a nice way to do the math notation in the wiki pages
4. stop using todo lists and use github's built in kanban board
   
## TODO (Application):
1. start adding docstrings to methods so we can eventually use jsdoc to generate the technical specifications
2. decide on a testing framework to use
3. Bot permissions. Only listen to privileged roles. 
4. !**kick** league member (set inactive)
5. !**ban** league member (prevent discord user id from entering league)
6. Set role min-max. can be one command. see **match_params** table in schema sketch
7. !**help** to list bot commands
8. !**matchmake**. set teams for the league's next event. will populate **matched player** table
   1. will show teams on matchmake by default
9. !**show-teams** show team allocations from !matchmake
10. Allow event announcements to listen for reactions once the bot has restarted
    1.  "Listening for reactions on old messages" discord.js guide
11.

## Introduction
- This is a bot application for Discord intended to help organize 15v15 matches.  
- All actions interfacing with this bot will be avaiable in the form of Discord reactions for participants and text channel commands for administrators. 

## Overview 
### Match organization
1. match **organizers** will be able to create an **match** at a given date and time
2. For a given server, there will be a set of pre defined **roles**
3. **Participants** can **RSVP** to an match by reacting to one of the match **announcement messages**
4. Each match will have two announcement messages. Role reactions to the first designate a participant's **primary** roles to the match; role reactions to the second message specify **secondary** roles. 
5. Participants can specify willingness to **sub** by adding the sub reaction. 
### Matchmaking - Role distribution
6. This application will attempt to distribute participants into **teams** of 15 given minimum, optimal, and max parameters for role populations.
7. Primary role signups are given greater **priority** than secondary role signups. Participants are permitted to have all primary, all secondy, or a mix of both signups.
8. Subs are given the lowest priority unless a role has yet to reach its minimum number of participants or another role has exceeded its maximum. 
### Matchmaking - Player rating
9. We will attempt to use hidden Elo ratings to distribute players and generate fair matches.
    - Elo starts with a value of 1000. $K$ begins at $100$ and decreases at a rate of $20log(10n)$ where $n$ is the number of matches played by that participant
    - Let $R_A$ be a participant's elo and $R_B$ be the mean elo of an opposing team.
    - Expectation $A$ beats $B$: $E_A$ = 1/(1+10<sup>(R<sub>B</sub>-R<sub>A</sub>)/400</sup>)
    - Result $S_A$ = 1 if A wins, 0 if B wins
    - $R'_A = R_A + K(S_A - E_A)$
  
10. Participants will be assigned teams based on rating first, then role adjustments will be made.
    - We use the [Karmarkarâ€“Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_differencing_method) to create workable partitioning approximations 
    - Sort participant Elo ratings in decreasing order. 
    - Given $k$ teams, allocate the greatest $k$ ratings to each subset such that the total difference between subsets is minimized until no participants remain
    - Adjust team membership to fit role parameters under the same constraint

## Functional Requirements
